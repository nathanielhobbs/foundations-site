## Shells: bash vs zsh vs PowerShell

A **shell** is the program interpreting what you type.

- **bash**: common (Linux/servers)
- **zsh**: default on many macOS installs
- **PowerShell**: Windows-native (different syntax)
- **Git Bash**: bash-like shell on Windows (good for class consistency)

For this course, we’ll try to keep commands compatible with **bash** when possible.
